# Robust-DAS-Detection
we propose a novel method combining an optical fiber Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system with a broadband generalized sparse covariance-fitting framework for robust DOA finding. The system utilizes a newly developed spiral-sensitized optical cable with enhanced sensitivity. Our DAS successfully tracked a non-cooperative speedboat.
